# Version Control Workflow — ML Ops Iris Classifier

## 1. Overview

This document describes the Git-based version control workflow used for this
Machine Learning project, developed as part of MLOps Lab Experiment 2.

- **Repository:** https://github.com/prb1812/mlops-iris-classifier
- **Primary language:** Python
- **Maintainer:** Pranjal Bagad

## 2. Branching Strategy

| Branch | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `main` | Stable, always-deployable code |
| `develop` | Integration branch for day-to-day development |
| `feature/<name>` | Individual features, branched from and merged back into `develop` |
| `conflict-demo-*` | Demonstration branches created for conflict resolution practice |

**Rule:** No one commits directly to `main`. All changes flow:

`feature/*` → Pull Request → `develop` → (periodically) merged into `main`.

## 3. Commit Convention

Commits follow a short, imperative style with a type prefix:

- `feat:` — add new functionality
- `fix:` — correct a bug
- `docs:` — documentation changes
- `chore:` — tooling/configuration changes
- `refactor:` — code changes with no behavior change
- `test:` — adding or fixing tests

Example:

`feat: add classification report to training script`

## 4. Standard Workflow (Feature Development)

```bash
git switch develop
git pull origin develop
git switch -c feature/<short-description>

# ... make changes ...

git add <files>
git commit -m "feat: <description>"
git push -u origin feature/<short-description>

# Open a Pull Request into develop on GitHub
# After review/approval, merge via GitHub
# Squash or merge commit according to the project convention

git branch -d feature/<short-description>
git push origin --delete feature/<short-description>
